## Example of an nginx instance which load balances to an apache instance.
version: '3'

services:
  proxy:
    image: nginx:1.13 # this will use the latest version of 1.13.x
    ports:
      - '80:80' # expose 80 on host and sent to 80 in container
    #This is called a volume but is actually a bind mount
    #The :ro at the end makes the bind mount RO to the container
    volumes: 
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro
  web:
    image: httpd  # this will use httpd:latest
